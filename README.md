#About the PokeDex 
Welcome to the PokeDex! This is my first FlatIron project. I have a simple CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project that works as a pokedex for you via scraped information. Boiler plate installation instructions are below. Once properly installed use  ruby ./bin/poke-dex - to start the program. You can check out the project requirements here as well. 

Fufilled Project Requirements: 

README file contains the following sections: *
A short description
Install instructions
A contributor's guide
A link to the license for your code

CLI Essentials *
Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
Pull data from an external source
Implement both list and detail views. The data provided must go at least one level deep.
The application is pretty DRY

Ruby Essentials *
Basic control flow - how "if" statements work
Variable scopes - method, instance and class
Object instantiation - #new (and possibly #initialize)
The meaning of the "self" keyword
Method types - class vs. instance methods
Method return types - knowing what methods return
Iterating through collections - at least using #each with a block


# PokeDex

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/poke_dex`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'poke_dex'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install poke_dex

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
